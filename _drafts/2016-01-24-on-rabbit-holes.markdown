Learning to program is not a linear process. There are a _lot_ of things to learn. It's hard to decide what to focus on. The first thing to realize is that you cannot learn everything. There will always be more to learn. It doesn't matter how experienced you become. Knowing that, the key is prioritizing what you want to learn. Some things are important for everyone to know. Know your tools. Know your text editor, whichever one you choose. Learn how git works. Get comfortable with a package manager for your language. You don't need to do these things immediately, but keep an eye on your progress. If your lack of knowledge about git (or whatever it is) starts substantially slowing down your ability to code, think about dedicating some time to learning your tools.

In addition, as a newbie programmer, most projects you could do are things that have already been done. What's the value of repeating someone else's work? Your version is unlikely to be better than something that's already written. But just because your version isn't perfect, that doesn't mean it wasn't worthwhile writing. Like practicing most things, quantity is incredibly valuable. Write a lot of code. And if you've written something someone else already wrote, so much the better! After you write your version, look at theirs. What did they do differently? Is it better, or worse? Did they do anything that you hadn't known how to do, but that would be useful in your own program?
