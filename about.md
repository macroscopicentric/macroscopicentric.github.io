I'm a junior developer currently working at [Cozy](https://cozy.co/).

Some of my favorite personal projects I've done:

- [Cat Nickname Generator](http://cat-nicknames.herokuapp.com/) — A random cat nickname generator based on actual nicknames used by my actual roommates for their cat.

- [Library World](http://library-world.herokuapp.com/) — A text adventure that takes place in a variety of fictional libraries.
