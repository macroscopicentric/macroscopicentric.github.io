1. Mentioning someone (by name or username) negatively without @ing them is called a subtweet.
2. If you start a tweet by @ing someone, Twitter will treat it as a reply even if it's not. This means it will show up in your "Tweets & replies" tab but not the default "Tweets" tab. It also means the tweet will only be displayed on the timelines of the people who follow both you and the person you've @ed. To get around this, put the @-mention somewhere else in your tweet, or prefix the @-mention with a period. (The latter used to be a negative thing, I think, but isn't anymore?)
3. Try to avoid having a default egg icon. Egg icons are typically distrusted because serial harassers regularly create new accounts without bothering to change the icons.
4. The easiest way to find cool new people to follow is to follow the people the people you follow follow. (You follow?)
