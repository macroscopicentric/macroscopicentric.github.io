<li>Mentioning someone (by name or username) negatively without @ing them is called a subtweet.</li>
<li>If you start a tweet by @ing someone, Twitter will treat it as a reply even if it's not. This means it will show up in your &quot;Tweets &amp; replies&quot; tab but not the default &quot;Tweets&quot; tab. It also means the tweet will only be displayed on the timelines of the people who follow both you and the person you've @ed. To get around this, put the @-mention somewhere else in your tweet, or prefix the @-mention with a period. (The latter used to be a negative thing, I think, but isn't anymore?)</li>
<li>Try to avoid having a default egg icon. Egg icons are typically distrusted because serial harassers regularly create new accounts without bothering to change the icons.</li>
<li>The easiest way to find cool new people to follow is to follow the people the people you follow follow. (You follow?)</li>
